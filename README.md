This repo contains packages for active path planning for 3D reconstruction. The planning is based on voxblox map representations. Perception simulation is performed in unreal engine 4 worlds.

# Installation
TODO: coming soon.

# Packages
More detailed information for every package is found in their respective readmes_

* **unreal_cv_ros**
  Simulate 3D perception for MAVs in an unreal engine 4 game.

* **mav_active_3d_planning**
  Active pathplanning algorithms.
  
# Known issues / todos
* Unreal turn rate is sometimes slow, leading to wrong angles of taken images for high yaw rates (especially standard mode)
